# Prompt Chaining with Claude: A Practical Guide

This repository contains the code examples and implementations discussed in my substack [article](https://open.substack.com/pub/jarredrobidouxx/p/prompt-chaining-with-claude?r=24t5ur&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true) on prompt chaining with Claude. 

## What's Inside

- Basic prompt chaining implementation
- Two practical examples:
  - NBA player statistics processing
  - Excel file manipulation with multiple transformations

## Code Examples

The repository includes two main functions:

- `chain()`: For basic prompt chaining operations
- `chain_excel()`: For Excel-specific data processing

## Prerequisites

- Anthropic API key ([Get one here](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys))
- Python 3.7+
- Basic understanding of APIs
- Required packages: pandas, anthropic, openpyxl

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Add your Anthropic API key to your environment variables
4. Check out the example notebooks to see prompt chaining in action
